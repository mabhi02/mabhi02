## What you'll find here

This is where I experiment, build, and break things. My repositories range from research prototypes to production-ready systems, with a focus on AI/ML applications that solve real problems.

**Currently obsessed with:**
- Meta-learning and adaptive systems
- RAG architectures that actually work at scale
- Making AI more accessible through better tooling
- Edge computing and model optimization

## Recent builds

**[AVM-CORE](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Tthkmz0aMIcVs_6fwQNNUyGvt4y5vxb4/view)** - Adaptive Validation Model w/ COmpositional REasoning framework combining meta-learning with compositional reasoning  
**[MATRIX](https://github.com/mabhi02/MATRIX)** - Thompson sampling meets reinforcement learning in high-dimensional spaces  
**[DeepFake Detection](https://github.com/mabhi02/Info290T-Deepfake-Detection)** - Computer vision system for detecting AI-generated content using advanced models  
**SQL Learning Platform** - Interactive visualizations for database concepts (used in Berkeley courses)  
**Community Health Chatbot** - RAG system deployed across rural communities  
**Email Intelligence** - Chrome extension that learns your writing style  

## My approach

I believe in building things that actually work. Most of my projects start as solutions to problems I'm facing in research or real applications, then evolve into more generalizable systems.

**Languages I reach for:** Python for ML/research, JavaScript for quick prototypes, C++ when performance matters, SQL for everything data

**Favorite stack right now:** Python + PyTorch + FastAPI + React + PostgreSQL

## Current experiments

- Fine-tuning small language models for domain-specific tasks
- Building better vector databases from scratch
- Exploring multi-agent systems for collaborative reasoning
- Optimizing models for edge deployment

## Want to collaborate?

I'm always down to work on interesting problems, especially if they involve:
- Novel ML architectures
- Real-world AI deployments
- Educational technology
- Healthcare applications

Drop me a line if you want to build something cool together.

*Most of my best ideas come from trying to solve problems I actually have.*
